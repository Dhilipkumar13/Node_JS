Node JS:
  Node js is javascript runtime environment build on the chrome v8 Javascript engine
chrome - V8
firefox - spider monkey
safari - javascript core
microsoft - chakra

  *** Node is program that include JavaScript V8 engine with some module that give us capability which is not available in browser ***
  *** we can access file system, network and some other properties ***

How it works?
  node js handle multple request using thread.
  *** node is "asyncronus" which handle multiple request with limited thread ***
  node continuesly monitor Event queue because database prepared query it put notification in event queue then thread pass information to client.

Node modules?
  * http
  * os
  * file
  * event

Global Object?
  * console -> console.log(),console.error()
  * setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate, clearTimeout, clearInterval, clearImmediate
    setInterval - it is call function in certain interval,
                  *** it called continously untile clearInterval or windows closed
  * __dirname
  * __filename

  "In browser " all function and variable can be access by windows object 
    basically all fuction while call with prefix window object
    likely
    ***  console.log() -->>  window.console.log()
          setTimeout() -->>  window.setTimeout()
  "In node " we cannot access variable and function globally
   ***  console.log() -->>  global.console.log()
        setTimeout() -->>  global.setTimeout()
